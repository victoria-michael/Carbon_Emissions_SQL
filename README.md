# Carbon_Emissions_SQL

**Overview**
This project analyzes carbon emission data from various countries over the years using MySQL. The dataset includes key metrics such as total CO2 emissions (in thousand metric tons) and emissions per capita. The analysis uses SQL and aims to provide insights that can inform and aid decision-making related to climate change.

# Features
a. Data Ingestion: Loads carbon emission data from **Kaggle** (CO2_Emit).

b. Data Cleaning: check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    i. Visualizes emission trends over time.

    ii. Compares emissions across different countries.


# Visualizations: 
Used PowerBI to create interactive charts and dashboards for exploring the data.
