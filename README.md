**Overview**
This project analyzes carbon emission data to identify trends, key contributors.  The analysis uses SQL and aims to provide insights that can inform policy and decision-making related to climate change.

# Features
a. Data Ingestion: Loads carbon emission data from [data source, e.g., CSV files, databases].

b. Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    i. Visualizes emission trends over time.

    ii. Compares emissions across different countries.


# Visualizations: 
Used PowerBI to create interactive charts and dashboards for exploring the data.
